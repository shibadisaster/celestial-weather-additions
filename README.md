# Celestial Weather Additions

Unofficial addon for Factorio mod
[Celestial Weather](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/celestial-weather) that adds
more weather VFX for some newer modded planets! Originally made for a personal
playthrough but I decided to upload it :3

This mod is intended to be highly customizable in the same way the base
Celestial Weather mod is. Almost every effect/change can be modified or toggled
in mod settings. Currently adds the following VFX to modded planets:

## [Rubia](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rubia)

[![Rubia preview](https://tedflixapp.xyz/resources/factorio/rubia_t.mp4)]

- Rubia's wind effects are much more intense and particles move much faster to
  make them more representative of the 300km/h wind speed

## [Vesta](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/skewer_planet_vesta)

- Vesta has more pronounced fog and clouds in order to make the boundary of the
  sea of clouds look more diffuse and less abrupt

## [Muria](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Muria)

- Muria has acidic fog with magenta spores (from the acidophile lichens)
  floating around as well as green acid clouds

## [Paracelsin](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Paracelsin)

- (DISABLED BY DEFAULT) Paracelsin, being a cryovolcanic planet, is now subject
  to a volcanic winter to differentiate it from other frozen planets (and to
  further justify its default 0% solar power in atmosphere), meaning it has
  black ashy snowfall and is always dark

## [Rabbasca](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/planet-rabbasca)

- Rabbasca has clouds, fog, dust, and magenta energy sparks to represent the
  planet's energy field

## [Cubium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cubium)

## [Pelagos](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pelagos)

- Pelagos has altered color grading to make it look more tropical and
  differentiate it from water coloration on other planets, also includes slight
  water surface caustics (lowland fog <3)
