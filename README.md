# Celestial Weather Additions

Unofficial addon for Factorio mod
[Celestial Weather](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/celestial-weather) that adds
more weather VFX for some newer modded planets! Originally made for a personal
playthrough but I decided to upload it :3

This mod is intended to be highly customizable in the same way the base
Celestial Weather mod is. Almost every effect/change can be modified or toggled
in mod settings. Currently adds the following VFX to modded planets:

- [Rubia](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/rubia)'s wind effects are much more
  intense and particles move much faster to make them more representative of the
  300km/h wind speed
- [Vesta](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/skewer_planet_vesta) has more pronounced
  fog and clouds in order to make the boundary of the sea of clouds look more
  diffuse and less abrupt
- [Muria](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Muria) has acidic fog with magenta
  spores (from the acidophile lichens) floating around as well as green acid
  clouds
- (DISABLED BY DEFAULT) [Paracelsin](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Paracelsin),
  being a cryovolcanic planet, is now subject to a volcanic winter to
  differentiate it from other frozen planets (and to further justify its default
  0% solar power in atmosphere), meaning it has black ashy snowfall and is
  always dark
- [Rabbasca](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/planet-rabbasca) has clouds, fog,
  dust, and magenta energy sparks to represent the planet's energy field
- [Cubium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cubium) has clouds and blue energy
  sparks
- [Panglia](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/panglia_planet) has teal/cyan clouds
  and dust
- [Igrys](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Igrys) has orange starlike particles and
  dust
- [Khemia](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alchemy-khemia) has magenta starlike
  particles and dust
- [Pelagos](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pelagos) has altered color grading to
  make it look more tropical and differentiate it from water coloration on other
  planets, also includes slight water surface caustics (lowland fog <3)

Certain effects made using
