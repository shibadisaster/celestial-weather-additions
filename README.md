Addon for Factorio mod
[Celestial Weather](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/celestial-weather) that adds
more weather VFX for some newer modded planets! Originally made for a personal
playthrough but I decided to upload it :3

This mod is intended to be highly customizable in the same way the base
Celestial Weather mod is. Currently adds the following VFX to modded planets:

- Rubia's wind effects are much more intense and particles move much faster to
  make them more representative of the 300km/h wind speed
- Vesta has more pronounced fog and clouds in order to make the boundary of the
  sea of clouds look more diffuse and less abrupt
- Muria has acidic green fog with magenta spores (from the acidophile lichens)
  floating around
- (REDESIGN) Paracelsin, being a cryovolcanic planet, is now subject to a
  volcanic winter to differentiate it from other frozen planets, meaning it has
  black ashy snowfall and is always dark

Certain effects made using
[mebiusbox's EffectTextureMaker](https://mebiusbox.github.io/contents/EffectTextureMaker/)
