# celestial-weather-extensions

Addon for Factorio mod Celestial Weather that adds more weather VFX for some
newer modded planets! Currently adds the following VFX to planets:

- Rubia's wind effects are much more intense and particles move much faster
- Muria has acidic green fog with magenta spores (from the acidophile lichens)
  floating around
- Vesta has more pronounced fog and clouds in order to make the boundary of the
  sea of clouds look more diffuse and less abrupt
- Rabbasca has purple rifts that slowly open up to match the art of the planet
- Cubium has small cubes that float up from the ground
- (TWEAK) Paracelsin, being a cryovolcanic planet, has ashy snowfall to
  differentiate it from other frozen planets
