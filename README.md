Addon for Factorio mod
[Celestial Weather](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/celestial-weather) that adds
more weather VFX for some newer modded planets! Originally made for a personal
playthrough but I decided to upload it :3

This mod is intended to be highly customizable in the same way the base
Celestial Weather mod is. Almost every parameter can be turned on or off in mod
settings. Currently adds the following VFX to modded planets:

- Rubia's wind effects are much more intense and particles move much faster to
  make them more representative of the 300km/h wind speed
- Vesta has more pronounced fog and clouds in order to make the boundary of the
  sea of clouds look more diffuse and less abrupt
- Muria has acidic fog with magenta spores (from the acidophile lichens)
  floating around as well as green acid clouds
- (DISABLED BY DEFAULT) Paracelsin, being a cryovolcanic planet, is now subject
  to a volcanic winter to differentiate it from other frozen planets (and to
  further justify its 0% solar power in atmosphere), meaning it has black ashy
  snowfall and is always dark
- Rabbasca has clouds, fog, dust, and magenta energy sparks to represent the
  planet's energy field
- Cubium has clouds and blue energy sparks
- Panglia has teal/cyan clouds and dust
- Igrys has orange starlike particles and dust
- Khemia has magenta starlike particles and dust
- (DISABLED BY DEFAULT) Pelagos has altered color grading to make it look more
  tropical and differentiate it from water coloration on other planets, also
  includes slight water surface caustics (lowland fog <3)

Certain effects made using
